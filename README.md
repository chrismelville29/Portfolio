[JFRRS](https://github.com/chrismelville29/Jfrrs): This app I created in breaks from school displays data from NCAA Cross Country and Track and field results. Users can view all athletes from a conference sorted by events of their choosing, or select an athlete and conference to see which athletes from the chosen conference are most similar to the selected athlete.

[Breaking Down the Black Box](https://cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/2324/explainable-ai/final-results/): This website explains my senior capstone project, where my group investigated the effectiveness of several Explainable AI Techniques.

[Minnesota Mapping](https://chrismelville29.shinyapps.io/mn_mapping/): This Shiny app uses the Leaflet package to display self care difficulty and internet access across different age groups in Minnesota and the Greater Twin Cities region (all data used to make the maps are publicly available).
